## Work Day Scheduler
This is a simple hour planner for 9:00am-5:00pm. To use the app, simply click on the dotted line for the intended hour block, enter some text, and click either "save" or "delete" to store or remove the entered text. Saving locally stores entries so that they'll remain when the page is reloaded, and deleting clears any entered text and locally stores an empty string.
